### An e-commerce website built with React + Chakra UI + fakestore API.
Some features implemented:
1. Cart
2. Checkout
3. Login Page
4. Product Filter Page
5. Product details page
6. Payment gateway(not implemented), etc.

Authenticated users can view products, add them to cart in desired quantities and checkout when done.
Please Note; Images of products may not tally with the general idea of the website. More attention is paid to logic than layout.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
